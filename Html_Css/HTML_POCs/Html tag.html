<!---The <embed> element renders an element that wraps around interactive content, including images, videos, and even other web pages. This is achieved with tools such as browser plug-ins. However, since most modern browsers no longer support plug-ins, there are other tags to use instead of <embed>. This includes:

Playing video content with the <video> element.
Displaying images with the <img> element.
Rendering additional markup with the <iframe> element.-->
